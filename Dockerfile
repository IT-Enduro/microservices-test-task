# PRODUCTION DOCKERFILE
# ---------------------
# This Dockerfile allows to build a Docker image of the NestJS application
# and based on a NodeJS 16 image. The multi-stage mechanism allows to build
# the application in a "builder" stage and then create a lightweight production
# image containing the required dependencies and the JS build files.
